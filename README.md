Celibrium is a text-based fantasy game made as part of a university group project, and its currently unfinished.
The files uploaded here were made by me featuring code done by only me, except for the main file which contains code by both me and my teammate (Corey Morris)

I plan to finish this game on my own without use=ing my teammates code, so that I get more from this project as a learning experience.
