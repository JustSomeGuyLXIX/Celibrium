Celibrium is a text-based fantasy game made as part of a university group project.
The files uploaded here were made by me featuring code done by only me, except for the main file which contains code by both me and my teammate (Corey Morris)

It is currently unfinished, with features, locations and lore planned not being implimented. However, as I was incharge of making the the first half of the game (first 2 locations), along with many of the features used throughout, the first half while not fully complete is playable.
I plan to finish this game on my own without using my teammates code, so that I get more from this project as a learning experience.
